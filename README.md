- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sud0nym4315
- Iâ€™m interested in C++, Python3, Pentesting and Cybersecurity 
- Iâ€™m currently touching up on my Python3, always learning more on C++, and mastering pentesting
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on C++ projects and Pentesting tool development such as scanners, bot software, DoS tools and more
- How to reach me: Like id ever tell! lol jk. You can reach me on Discord @Sud0nym4315#1889

P.S: It has definitely been a while since I logged into github, so there are a lot of old (n00b) projects. Just
know that I am constantly working on new and more complex projects, so there is a lot behind
the scenes here. #NotAShittyDev
